# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository, **alx-project-0x02-setup**, serves as an introduction to setting up and working with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Learn how to scaffold a Next.js project.
* Understand file-based routing in Next.js.
* Create reusable components with TypeScript.
* Apply Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design.

This project will gradually build up from the basic setup to implementing components, routing, API integration, and structuring a full Next.js application.
